# Anisotropic GNNs
## Required Packages
Use requirements.txt to install packages with pip (create a virtual env first), as conda won't work.
## TODO
- [ ] Think of anisotropic benchmarks (isonet will perform badly, anisonet will perform well)
- [ ] Look for inspiration in the literature
- [ ] Ground possible results for grid graphs using theorems learned in 048001 (thinking about graph products for instance)
